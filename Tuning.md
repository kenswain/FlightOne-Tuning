*** FlightOne Tuning Steps ***


btw some good maneuvers for testing:
* hover (check for slow oscillations/low*P and fast oscillations = high*P)
* try hovering without applying pitch/roll/yaw (watch for drifts = low*I)
* if it should feel tricky/unresponsive to maintain a constant hover, I and/or kD filtering could be too low
* keep checking ur motor heat, if it feels like u cant touch them it could be: high D, high kD filtering, too little filtering and/or motor timing too high
* thrust straight up without moving horizontally (watch for drifts = low*I and head bobs = offset*CG)
* after thrusting straight up, let it drop straight down without throttle or moving horizontally (should stay level if P isnt too low)
* do quick flips/rolls/yaws with fast stops (watch for bounce backs = high*I)
* thrust in one direction horizontally, cut power, 180ยบ turn in the oposite direction and then thrust in the oposite direction (watch propwash = low D or high kD filtering)
* split S dive straight down and then catch it without moving in any horizontal direction and repeat with slight forward direction (also watch for propwash)
* further maneuvers are a little hard to explain, but u should get the idea ^^
and note i just mentioned the most general causes for the possible negative effects, which could also be caused by bad filtering or other parameters(edited)
